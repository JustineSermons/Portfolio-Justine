    <div class="about-container">
    <p class="about-text">Hello! I'm Justine, a student at the University of Central Florida pursuing a bachelor's degree in Digital Media for the Web and Interactive Media Track.
      I've always been interested in a variety of things connected to Digital Media such as video games, video editing, design, development, and social media. While pursuing my degree, 
      I've learned more about the Digital Media field and thought I would be best suited for a UI/UX or Front End type of role. However, I'd be open to different careers that align with my 
      interests and skillset! I've always enjoyed learning about new technologies and design-related things and would like to continuously improve on my skills for both. In my free time I like
      exploring social media, watching shows/movies, playing video games, and learning Japanese.

            <strong>Summary:</strong> Exercise App Design allowing users to
            explore workouts, keep track of their duration and reps when
            exercising, and see different statistics for their workout progress.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Design Decisions:</strong> A simple design was used for this
            project for simplicity and ease of use. A light lavender purple
            color was used to make the workout app have a more relaxing and
            calming type of feel and look for users who want to workout with
            peace of mind.

            deadlines, mark tasks as completed, see task completion status, and
            have a profile.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Design Decisions:</strong> A light blue was used for the
            background to not be too distracting with a salmony pink to easily
            be distinguishable from the background. Tasks can easily be seen by
            users in a scrollable list with all the options to manage tasks in
            the same area.

            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Design Decisions:</strong> The favorited option was changed
            to be above the like option to decrease the amount of time to get to
            the favorites list. Favorites collection was changed to a different
            layout for more ease of use with the option to like and see liked
            videos along with the user's favorited videos.

            <br />
            <strong>Design Decisions:</strong> A nice variety of blueberry-like
            colors were used to make the flashcard app look more interesting and
            appealing. It helps the app stand out and possibly make users want
            to create and study flashcards even more.
