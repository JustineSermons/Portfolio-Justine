        I am a Digital Media student at UCF immersing myself in various aspects
        of the field, such as full stack development, mobile development, and
        UX/UI Design. My focus is centered towards Front End Web Development and
        UX/UI Design, areas that allow me to combine my passion for creativity
        and technology. I am motivated to create and design innovative digital
        experiences and user-friendly designs that resonate with users. I am
        also driven to keep gaining more and more knowledge and skills in the
        vast field of Digital Media to not only improve myself, but to also
        contribute to meaningful projects that make a positive impact in how
        people interact with technology.

          <p class="project-description">
            <strong>Summary:</strong> Exercise App Design allowing users to
            explore workouts, keep track of their duration and reps when
            exercising, and see different statistics for their workout progress.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Design Decisions:</strong> A simple design was used for this
            project for simplicity and ease of use. A light lavender purple
            color was used to make the workout app have a more relaxing and
            calming type of feel and look for users who want to workout with
            peace of mind.

            <strong>Summary:</strong>To-Do App allowing users to register,
            login, create and manage tasks, filter and delete tasks, set
            deadlines, mark tasks as completed, see task completion status, and
            have a profile.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Design Decisions:</strong> A light blue was used for the
            background to not be too distracting with a salmony pink to easily
            be distinguishable from the background. Tasks can easily be seen by
            users in a scrollable list with all the options to manage tasks in
            the same area.

            feature that allows users to easily access liked and favorited
            videos all in one place.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Design Decisions:</strong> The favorited option was changed
            to be above the like option to decrease the amount of time to get to
            the favorites list. Favorites collection was changed to a different
            layout for more ease of use with the option to like and see liked
            videos along with the user's favorited videos.

            <strong>Summary:</strong> Flash Card App that allows users to create
            and study flashcards. Users can also edit, delete, randomize,

            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Design Decisions:</strong> A nice variety of blueberry-like
            colors were used to make the flashcard app look more interesting and
            appealing. It helps the app stand out and possibly make users want
            to create and study flashcards even more.
